# ParkingTracker

There is a parking lot and it has 2 levels A and B, each level has the capacity to park 20
vehicles of any size. Level A has parking space numbered from 1-20 and level B has parking
space numbered from 21-40. Use this information to build a system that supports below
mentioned operations.
1. Automatically assign a parking space to a new vehicle.
2. Retrieve parking spot number of any particular vehicle(consider vehicle number as the
unique identifier of the vehicle.) output should return level and parking spot number eg
{“level”: A, “spot”:19}

● Design and build a terminal based application which facilitates above two operations in a
scalable and efficient manner.
● Keep the code modular and clean
● Avoid using a database by using in-memory storage (RAM)
● Share the link of the github repository (It is a must) for final assessment.
